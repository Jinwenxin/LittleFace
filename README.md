# LittleFace
Generate some different faces with letters. The project is very easy, but it's interesting, at least, I think so. The project is written in C#. It's an ASP.NET Core project. I'm a tester in China. And I don't know what I really like. This project costs me one day to finish. I don't know if I would develop it continuously.
